Here‚Äôs a thorough `AGENTS.md` file designed to instruct **Codex** (or any structured AI agent) to audit types across your monorepo-style framework. This file sets standards, outlines the full process, and ensures consistent execution when generating reports.

---

# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This document defines the **type auditing protocol** for all AI agents (Codex or otherwise) contributing to this framework. It ensures shared types are properly centralized, eliminates redundancy, and maintains consistency across internal packages and tools.

---

## üéØ Primary Objective

Systematically **audit and synchronize** TypeScript types across the `packages/`, `tools/`, and `packages/types` directories. Each run of this protocol should produce a full report for **one selected target** (either a single package or tool).

---

## Workflow Overview

1. **Create or Use `types-map/` Directory**

   * Ensure a top-level directory named `types-map/` exists at the project root.
   * Each run should generate one Markdown report inside `types-map/`.

2. **Select One Target**

   * Choose a single **package** (from `packages/`) or **tool** (from `tools/`) to audit.
   * Only one should be handled per execution.

3. **Analyze Local Types**

   * Scan all `*.ts` and `*.tsx` files in the selected target.
   * Extract and catalog every:

     * `type`
     * `interface`
     * `enum`
     * `class` if used solely for typing
   * Record the file location, structure, and name of each declaration.

4. **Cross-Reference Shared Types**

   * Search `packages/types/` for existing type definitions.
   * For each type/interface:

     * ‚úÖ **Match Found:** Ensure the local type is **imported** from `@farm/types` and not redefined.
     * ‚ö†Ô∏è **No Match:** Evaluate whether the local type should **be moved** to `packages/types/`:

       * Is it reused across multiple packages or tools?
       * Does it define core domain logic or public API surfaces?

5. **Detect Violations**

   * ‚ùå Flag:

     * Duplicate types defined across multiple packages/tools.
     * Local types that duplicate or shadow shared ones.
     * Out-of-sync type definitions (name match, but structure differs).
     * Any type not exported correctly from `packages/types/`.

6. **Generate Report**

   * Create a new file in `types-map/` with the format:

     ```
     types-map/{targetType}-{targetName}.md
     ```

     Example:

     * `types-map/package-auth.md`
     * `types-map/tool-dev-server.md`

---

## Report Format

Each report should include:

```md
# Type Audit Report for {targetType}: {targetName}

## üì¶ Target
- **Type:** package | tool
- **Name:** {targetName}

## üìÅ Local Types Summary
List all locally declared types/interfaces with file paths.

## üîÅ Shared Type Cross-Reference
- ‚úÖ Types correctly imported from `@farm/types`
- ‚ùå Duplicates found across other packages
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Types that should be centralized but are currently local

## üö´ Violations
Detailed list of:
- Redundant types
- Out-of-sync definitions
- Missing exports in `packages/types`

## ‚úÖ Suggestions for Sync
Concrete suggestions like:
- Move `UserProfile` to `packages/types/auth.ts`
- Refactor `NotificationType` to import from `@farm/types/notifications`
```

---

## Standards

* Shared types **must** be located in `packages/types/` and exported through index files.
* All internal consumers should **import** types via `@farm/types`.
* Every report must be complete and reproducible before proceeding to another package/tool.

---

## Agent Constraints

* Do **not** edit any files directly.
* Do **not** move or delete type definitions automatically.
* Focus solely on analysis and reporting.
