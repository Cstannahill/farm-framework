import { DeployEngine } from "@farm-framework/deployment";

const engine = new DeployEngine();
const result = await engine.deploy({
  platform: "railway",
  environment: "production",
});
```

### Platform Detection

```typescript
import { PlatformDetector } from "@farm-framework/deployment";

const detector = new PlatformDetector();
const recommendation = await detector.detectOptimalPlatform();
console.log(`Recommended: ${recommendation.recommended}`);
```

### Cost Estimation
