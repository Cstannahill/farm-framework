# Assistant UI Quickstart

To scaffold the chat interface run:

```bash
farm add ui assistant
```

This installs the necessary `@assistant-ui` packages, updates Tailwind and generates a chat page under `apps/web/src/pages/AssistantChat.tsx`.

Wrap your app with `<AssistantProvider>` and navigate to `/assistant` to start chatting.
