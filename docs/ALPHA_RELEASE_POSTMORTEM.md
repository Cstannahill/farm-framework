# FARM Framework Alpha Release - Post-Mortem

## Release Summary: v0.1.0 (June 11, 2025)

**Status**: ✅ Successfully Published  
**Packages Published**: 9 packages to npm under `@farm-framework` organization  
**Time**: ~8 minutes ago

## 🎯 What Went Right

✅ **Release Automation**: Scripts worked flawlessly - build, test, version, tag, and publish  
✅ **NPM Organization**: Successfully created `@farm-framework` npm organization  
✅ **Core Packages**: All 6 intended public packages published successfully:

- `farm-framework` - Main CLI tool
- `@farm-framework/core` - Core functionality
- `@farm-framework/type-sync` - Type synchronization utility
- `@farm-framework/types` - Shared TypeScript types
- `@farm-framework/api-client` - HTTP client utilities
- `@farm-framework/ui-components` - UI components

✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive release process documentation created  
✅ **Version Management**: Proper semantic versioning and git tagging

## ⚠️ Issue: Internal Packages Published

**Problem**: 3 internal packages were accidentally published:

- `@farm-framework/testing` ❌ (should be internal only)
- `@farm-framework/template-validator` ❌ (should be internal only)
- `@farm-framework/dev-server` ❌ (should be internal only)

**Root Cause**: While changeset config had `ignore` array, packages weren't marked as `private: true` in their package.json

## 🚨 Immediate Actions Taken

1. **Deprecated Internal Packages**: All 3 internal packages deprecated on npm with clear message
2. **Fixed Package.json**: Added `"private": true` to all internal packages
3. **Documentation**: Updated package release strategy docs

## 📋 Lessons Learned

### For Future Releases:

1. **Double Protection**: Use both changeset `ignore` AND `"private": true` in package.json
2. **Dry Run Verification**: Always verify package count in dry run matches expected public packages
3. **Pre-publish Checklist**: Add package privacy check to pre-release health check

### Release Process Improvements:

1. ✅ Release automation works perfectly
2. ✅ NPM authentication and org setup successful
3. ✅ Git tagging and changelog generation working
4. 🔧 Need better internal package filtering

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 24 hours):

1. **Test Installation**: Verify all public packages install correctly
2. **Create Demo Project**: Build a real demo using published packages
3. **Documentation Update**: Update installation instructions

### Short Term (Next Week):

1. **External Testing**: Invite developers to test alpha release
